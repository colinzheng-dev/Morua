Au lieu des 8 000 mètres prévus, il culmine à 5 200 mètres. A cette hauteur, les vents ne poussent pas la tête du nuage vers le nord, mais vers l’ouest, en direction de Tahiti."

      "content": "One hour after the explosion, the radioactive cloud began reaching the atoll of Tematangi, which was the location of the nearest meteorological station to the Mururoa test site from which the bomb was detonated. The cloud then moved over the inhabited atoll of Nukutepipi, nicknamed the “billionaire’s island”, and across to the atolls of Anuanurunga and Anuanuraro. The fallout finally reached Tahiti at around 2am on July 19th 1974."

      "content": "Between the time of the explosion and the arrival of the radioactive cloud over Tahiti, more than 42 hours had passed. Yet, the island’s population was not informed of the approaching nuclear cloud. Despite the gravity of the situation and the risk of contamination, the local inhabitants were not asked to take shelter nor to refrain from consuming foodstuffs, milk and water which the authorities knew would be contaminated. The explosion of the bomb was not even mentioned in the local media."
