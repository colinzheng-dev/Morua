By studying declassified French military documents, we made our own evaluation of the radioactive doses to which the population was exposed from the explosion of Centaure. Our estimates show that the inhabitants of Tahiti and the surrounding islands of the Windward group were subjected to significant amounts of ionizing radiation. This represents almost 110,000 potential victims – at the time, the total population of French Polynesia was about 125,000. The islanders would have been subjected to doses higher than 1 mSv; that is the minimal level of exposure for an individual to be recognised as a victim as set by France’s official Committee for the Indemnification of Victims of Nuclear Tests, the CIVEN. This is far more than the 10,000 people who could claim compensation from the French state, as suggested in a recent report from the Polynesian health ministry; it is rather all of those who at the time were living in Tahiti and its surrounding islands and who have since developed one of the 23 illnesses now officially recognised as linked to radiation exposure under French law.

To reach that conclusion, we used data collected by the French joint radiological safety service, the SMSR, at the time of the explosion. This is the same data cited in a 2006 report by the French atomic energy commission, the CEA, in its re-evaluation of the doses of radiation to which local inhabitants were exposed. But comparing our calculations with those of the CEA, we found that the latter underestimated the level of exposure by as much as 40%.

This underestimation is the result of three miscalculations, as revealed by a careful study of the CEA report. First, in order to calculate the effective whole body dose received by the local population, the experts inexplicably used as their reference point the activity deposited on the ground during the first day of the event. Yet, activity deposition was recorded over several days following the cloud’s arrival. But instead of the 3,400,000 becquerels per square metre that were then recorded, the CEA used a number that was 27% smaller.

To assess the impact of the fallout at different places on the island, the CEA scientists compared measurements made on the side of the road to their data from the main radiological station located in Mahina, close to the French Polynesian capital Papeete. The ratios of these measurements were used to calculate the doses from radiation exposure throughout the island, as shown in the map below.

The CEA map featured in a 1997 French report provided to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, and also present in a 2006 French governement report reproduce the same map from a formerly secret document – but with a few changes to the original data.

The measurements made at Teahupoo, in south-west Tahiti, which recorded the highest contamination, had disappeared from the map. As had also those taken on the Plateau of Taravao, another of the most contaminated zones, situated in the south-east of the island. But one of the most important changes to the map concerned the zone of Papeete; where the original map indicated a coefficient of 0.1 to 0.3, the new version produced by the CEA in 2006 had replaced this with 0.1 and 0.2.

By using the data that was recorded at the time, the dose of radiation exposure for inhabitants in and around Papeete could have been up to three times greater than the CEA estimation as presented in its 2006 report and which serves as the official reference. In the case of Hitiaa, situated on the north-east of the island and which was exposed to a large amount of fallout, we calculated that the dose of ionizing radiation that infants under two would have received to their thyroids may have exceeded 50 mSv, as opposed to current official estimations capped at 49 mSv, and would today justify preventive treatment with iodine supplements. Meanwhile, an adult living in Teahupoo at the time would have received an effective dose of 9.40 mSv.

Last September, Disclose and INTERPRT travelled to Tahiti to meet one of the victims of the Centaure nuclear test. Aged 11 at the time, Valérie Voisin has few memories from the summer of 1974, when her island was covered with radioactive dust. She was then living in Papara, a few kilometres from Papeete. What the mother-of-three remembers clearly is the cyst that appeared on her left breast afterwards. Thirty years later it was removed, when she was diagnosed with cancer in 2008.

Valérie’s illness has had terrible and irremediable consequences; she has lost all her teeth and suffers from a degenerative spine condition, and a weak hip. “My doctor told me I have the skeleton of a lady of 90,” she said. Now she wants her five nieces to undergo medical tests, but they are refusing to do so. “They are frightened about what the doctors might find,” she explained.

On November 25th 2019, Valérie Voisin received official recognition from the French state that she was a victim of the country’s nuclear tests. To date, just 454 victims have been compensated.
