It was on July 2nd 1966 when France went ahead, in all secrecy, with its first atmospheric nuclear test over French Polynesia. At 5.34am that day, Aldéraban, as the bomb was codenamed, was detonated from a barge anchored on a blue lagoon close to the atoll of Moruroa. Just a few micro-seconds after the explosion, a fireball appeared which vaporised everything in its surrounding. The incandescent mass, with a heat of several thousands of degrees centigrade, rose up in the air, and then, as it cooled, became a vast cloud of radioactive dust. In the space of around ten minutes, the atomic mushroom-like form stabilised before being dispersed by winds.

In theory, the French military and the country’s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) had put in place a thorough plan to prevent nuclear fallout from landing on inhabited areas, beginning with the Gambier Islands, renowned for their culture of black pearls. But this investigation by Disclose and INTERPRT reveals a different story.
