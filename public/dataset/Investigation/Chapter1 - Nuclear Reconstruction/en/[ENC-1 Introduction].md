In 1971, France began its fifth year of nuclear weapon testing in the South Pacific. In June that year, for what would be the 24th atmospheric test above French Polynesia, the military chose to trigger a particularly powerful bomb that was designed to equip the missiles of France’s first nuclear-powered submarines. According to an official description by those who engineered it, the bomb, codenamed “Encélade” (Enceladus), presented “serious safety issues because of its large mass of highly enriched uranium”.

It was launched at 10.15am on June 12th 1971 and the explosion released around 500 kilotonnes of energy – which was 30 times more powerful than the US atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima. The blast from this bomb produced a gigantic atomic cloud that began moving with the wind. At 7pm it reached the small inhabited atoll of Tureia, in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia.
