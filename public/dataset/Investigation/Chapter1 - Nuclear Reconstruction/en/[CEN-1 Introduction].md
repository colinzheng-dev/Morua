In the history of France’s nuclear weapons tests, the year 1974 marked a turning point. After eight years of atmospheric nuclear testing, the military were readying to begin a series of underground testing, regarded as cleaner and, above all, less visible. But before that, France’s “Pacific experimentations centre”, the CEP, had established a programme for the final series of atmospheric tests which was described in an internal document as being “extremely tight”. 

The document is a 110-page summary report, dated November 26th 1974, on the last series of atmospheric blasts that had by then recently come to an end. “The difficult balance between security imperatives and the demands of the calendar” had been “brought to the limit of a breaking point”, it noted.

It was in that political and scientific context that, on July 17th 1974, France proceeded with its 41st nuclear experiment in the Pacific, triggered over the atoll of Muruoa. The codename for the bomb was “Centaure”.

Using available meteorological data from the date of the explosion, along with scientific measurements of the size of the post-blast radioactive particles, and previously unpublished information from French military archives, we modeled the hour-by-hour trajectory of the radioactove cloud. 

This study shows, for the first time, the extent of the radioactive fallout that landed on the island of Tahiti and the 80,000 inhabitants of its principal city, Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia.
