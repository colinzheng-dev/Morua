      "description": "According to the maps of the French Pacific Testing Centre, the CEP, which was in charge of coordinating the testing campaign, the island was at the heart of the exclusion zone established by the military, a prohibited area of several hundred kilometres around the atolls of Fangataufa and Muruoa. But unlike the inhabitants of neighbouring islands, those living on the Tureia atoll were not evacuated by the authorities before nuclear testing began.In 1971, according to Franceâ€™s national institute of statistics and economic studies, INSEE, 68 people were living on the atoll. They were joined during the testing campaign by around 800 members of the military.",
