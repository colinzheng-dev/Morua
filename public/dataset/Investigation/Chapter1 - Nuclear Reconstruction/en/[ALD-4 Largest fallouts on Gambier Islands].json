The most widely upheld hypothesis is that the contamination led to a wave of cancers, and that appears to be confirmed in a report by the local government of French Polynesia dated February 2020, the existence of which has hitherto never been revealed. It is the first official document to refer to a ‘cluster of [cases of] thyroid cancers’ in the Gambier Islands. The report, written by a French military doctor, notes that the cluster, “focalised on the islands subjected to fallout […] leaves little doubt about the role of ionizing radiation […] in the advent of this excess of cancer [cases]’.",
