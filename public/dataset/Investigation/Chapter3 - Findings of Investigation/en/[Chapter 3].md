## THE CANCER CLUSTER AMONG GAMBIER ISLANDERS

An on-the-ground investigation from Disclose in Mangareva, the principal island in the Gambier archipelago of French Polynesia, provided evidence of a significant occurrence of breast cancer and cancer of the thyroid gland in the families of 14 people who were interviewed there. All of them lived in the Gambier Islands during the French atmospheric nuclear bomb tests.



Disclose also obtained access to a hitherto confidential February 2020 report for the French Polynesian health ministry entitled 
<a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20509073-rapport-sur-les-consequences-sanitaires-des-essais-nucleaires-en-polynesie_fev2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="hyperlink">“The health consequences of French nuclear tests in the Pacific”</a>
. It officially recognises for the first time “the presence of a cluster of thyroid cancers” on the Gambier Islands. The cluster, noted the French military doctor who wrote the report, “leaves little doubt about the role of ionizing radiation […] in the advent of this excess of cancer [cases]”.

## AN ESTIMATED 2,000 FORMER TEST STAFF PRONE TO ILLNESS

Disclose gained access to the contents of an email that was exchanged among different services of the French defence ministry. Dated February 2017, it reveals for the first time the official estimated extent of cancer cases among former civilian and military personnel who were involved in France’s atmospheric nuclear bomb tests. Out of the around 6,000 staff who “resided on the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa between 1966 and 1974”, the ministry concluded that about a third of them – 2,000 people – “are or will contract a radio-induced cancer”. The email estimated that the amount to be paid in compensation “would therefore add up to […] 100 million euros”. Contacted by Disclose, the French armed forces ministry (the now renamed former defence ministry) dismissed the suggestion it had made such an estimation.

## TWO NUCLEAR DISASTERS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED

Two documents among declassified French military archives prove that the army high command knew of the dangers for the Polynesian population before triggering the atmospheric tests of the Aldébaran bomb (on July 2nd 1966) and the Centaure bomb (on July 17th 1974), both of which caused major exposure of the local population to radioactivity. The archives formally contradict claims by the defence ministry that the exposure was because of a surprise and sudden change in meteorological conditions.

One of the documents is a meteorological report – included in a wider report summarising the testing of Aldébaran and dated March 1967 – which shows that the military knew just three hours before the blast that the wind was blowing in the direction of Mangareva, the principal island in the Gambier chain. According to the procedural recommendations in force at the time, the bomb should not have been triggered that day.

The second document, dated November 26th 1974, set out that the military commanders should take note of the “trajectories of the principal air masses over a term of several days” – that is, the days that would follow each test. On July 17th 1974, the day when the Centaure bomb was exploded, the meteorological forecast was that the air masses would push the radioactive cloud to Tahiti, French Polynesia’s largest and most populated island, where the inhabitants of the capital city of Papeete then numbered around 80,000. The military knew of the danger, but chose not to alert the islanders or ask them to take shelter. The fallout from Centaure reached Tahiti 48 hours after it was detonated, causing the contamination of its population.

## FRANCE UNDERESTIMATED THE DOSES OF EXPOSURE

Using information from declassified French military archives, Disclose and INTERPRT, in collaboration with the Program on Science & Global Security (SGS) at Princeton University, were able to re-evaluate the estimations of the doses of radioactivity received by the civilian population of French Polynesia after the six most contaminating atmospheric tests.

In each of these re-evaluations, we identified a number of errors in the calculations presented in a 2006 report by France’s atomic energy commission, the CEA. For example, the CEA did not always take into account the drinking of contaminated rainwater in its calculations of the effective doses received to the entire body. As a result, the CEA calculations of the maximum dose received by the local inhabitants were between twice to ten times lower than our estimates, as indicated in the comparisons detailed further below.

The measurements are in millisieverts (mSv), used to calculate the effect of exposure to ionizing radiation. The comparison between the CEA estimates and those of Disclose, INTERPRT and SGS are presented against the codename of the atmospheric test bomb, the year it was triggered, and the contaminated geographical locations concerned by the estimations.

## DECEPTION BY THE COMMISSION FOR COMPENSATING VICTIMS

In 2010, France created a commission, called the CIVEN, dedicated to adjudicating compensation claims by civil and military victims of the nuclear testing campaign. In order to legitimise its decisions for the past 10 years, the CIVEN systematically resorts to the same argument. Namely, that the CEA’s 2006 evaluation of the ionising radiation doses received by the Polynesian population, which the CIVEN has adopted for its decisions on compensation claims, was validated in 2010 by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA document which supposedly validated the CEA estimations is regularly cited by the CIVEN but has never been made public.

We obtained that document and discovered that in fact it never validated the CEA figures. The reason for this was that the scientists who compiled the IAEA report did not have access to original data, from the time of the tests, because in 2010 the military archives had not been declassified. Without that data they could not make a judgment on the validity of the CEA’s re-evaluation figures. Furthermore, the CEA study was directly commissioned and financed by the French defence ministry.

Since being contacted by Disclose about the issue, the CIVEN recently changed some of the wording used in its official statements. It no longer refers to “data validated by a group of international experts commissioned by the IAEA”, but instead, “data whose methodology has been validated by a group of experts commissioned by the IAEA”.
