Cutting edge nuclear science, a trove of declassified documents, and investigative journalism expose the human and environmental impacts of French nuclear testing in the Pacific.

Between 1966 and 1996, France conducted 193 atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons tests in Polynesia in the Southern Pacific Ocean. These nuclear explosions profoundly affected the environment and health of local people and of French veterans involved in the testing program.

Using an archive of 2000 pages of declassified French government documents, hundreds of hours of computer simulations of the nuclear tests and fallout predictions, dozens of interviews in France and Polynesia, “Toxique” presents the results of a two-year long study on the consequences of French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the continued struggle of local communities and veterans to seek justice and compensation.

It sheds unprecedented light on the radiological and environmental contamination of the people of the Pacific through scientific research, journalism, and storytelling. It challenges existing official narratives of the consequences of the test, and reveals that more could have been done to protect the public and that justice is owed.

This work is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between a Princeton University nuclear expert, INTERPRT, a collective of architects specialising in the forensic analysis of environmental crimes, and investigative journalists from the media Disclose.
