The key source material of our investigation is a set of declassified documents from the French Ministry of Defence that broadly covers a period between 1966 and 1974 when it conducted 41 atmospheric tests in French Polynesia. The documents were made public in 2013 after a long legal battle between French and Polynesian victims rights organizations and the government but have not been scrutinized in detail until our investigation. The archive consists of 233 documents that come to over two thousand pages. We have organized the documents in chronological order following each nuclear test campaign for use by victims, researchers and the general public.
